          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p className="blog-desc">
            Often we need to keep our training data and trained models private for compliance and as well as
            to preserve our companies secrets.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            For example in the field of healthcare we dont want our Cloud GPU providers to have our patients health care
            data stored cleartext in the server ram. A crafty system administrator 
            could always copy the data for themselves or leak it publically.
          </p>
          <h1>Train on Encrypted Data</h1>
          <p className="blog-desc">
            With Homomorphic Encryption we not only keep the training data encrypted at rest, we also train our
            model on fully encrypted data, creating a fully encrypted training circuit. No sensitive data can leak out
            to the node provider whos hardware we are using.
