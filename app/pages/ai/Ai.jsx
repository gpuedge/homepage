          <h1>Introduction</h1>

          <p className="blog-desc">
            When building machine learning models, we often come across tasks 
            that would be more efficient and effective if they could be 
            parallelized. For example, if you want to train a large model 
            within a specific environment, you might consider using distributed 
            training. I'll share how to do this using Docker 
            containers (fully supported on GPUX), which allow you to create and destroy environments as 
            needed.
          </p>
          <h1>Train a model simultaneously on different GPUs</h1>
          <p className="blog-desc">
            Distributed learning is a method of training a model 
            simultaneously on different GPUs. With distributed learning, 
            you can train one model using all the GPUs available in the network. 
            This allows you to maximize your GPU resources and make better use 
            of compute power.

            You can create a Dockerfile to run PyTorch over a cluster 
            so that each node in the cluster runs the same code with training data. 
          </p>
          <h1>Training a single model with thousands of nodes</h1>
          <p className="blog-desc">
            The process of training a model is simple: 
            you just need to specify the data and the model, and then run 
            it through your favorite training algorithm. However, if you have 
            multiple GPUs or many machines at your disposal, distributing the 
            model across them becomes a more complex problem.

            One way to distribute a large-scale neural network across multiple GPUs 
            is called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/machine-learning/distributed-learning-overview.html">Distributed Learning</a>. 
            It allows you to train multiple models on different subsets of 
            data processed by different GPUs in parallel. You can then merge 
            these models together for further analysis or prediction.
          </p>
          <h1>Docker containers are perfect for this kind of task</h1>
          <p className="blog-desc">
            Docker containers are lightweight, portable and easy to use. 
            They allow us to create and destroy environments as needed. 
            For example, if you want to experiment with a new programming 
            language or framework, you can create a Docker container with 
            your new environment of choice and then destroy it afterward 
            without leaving any traces on the host machine or in any other 
            containers that also exist on that machine.

            Docker is not only used for development tasks; it is also 
            suitable for running production web applications because it 
            allows us to build images using base images provided by 
            third-party vendors (like Red Hat) which have already 
            been configured with security updates and other security 
            enhancements.

            GPUX supports Dockerfiles natively.
          </p>
          <h1>Machine learning tasks can take days to run</h1>
          <p className="blog-desc">
            One of the most powerful tools in machine learning is parallelization. 
            Parallelization is when you use multiple machines (or processes), 
            each running its own copy of your program, to do the same task faster.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            For example, let's say you have one machine with 8 cores and eight processes
            that each take 10 minutes to run. If you run them sequentially, then it will 
            take 80 minutes for all 8 processes to finish running! But if we run them 
            in parallel on different parts of the problem at once (e.g., 4 cores on 2 processes), 
            then it only takes 40 minutes total for all processes to complete.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            This makes sense: if you're waiting for a single process (or core) to 
            finish before starting another one, then doing so sequentially means that 
            any time wasted by any given process slows down all other tasks until it
            finishes its work--which wastes lots of time overall!
          </p>
          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p className="blog-desc">
            Distributed learning is a great way to massively scale up your 
            machine learning operation. It can be used for many 
            different kinds of tasks, from text classification to 
            computer vision, and it even works with existing 
            models/frameworks that you already know how to use!
